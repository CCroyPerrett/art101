			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Using AJAX, get information from an API and display that information on the web page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first, it was difficult for us because we found AJAX to be quite complicated compared to other topics covered in this
					course. This is probably because of our prior programming knowledge that helped us through most other assignments, but
					this assignment was different because we had never worked with anything like AJAX before. After following the lectures, we finally
					got somewhere with the formula given to us. The main problem though was that we needed to provide an ID number in the url and we didn't know
					what to return. Eventually we came up with the random berry and pokemon generator which gave it a purpose without us having to go deep
					into the parts of the API that we didn't understand. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was most definetley our most difficult assignment yet at first. Up untill now we have been mostly dealing with programming
						basics and singular new functions, implimenting ajax was a whole different beast. It was quite difficult to figure out all the moving
						pieces, especially when both the ajax functions and the APIs did not give as specific instructions as we would have liked. Especicially since
						not a single source had all the data we needed (in an easily accessible form). However, now after finishing this assignment, this is definetley
						the most valuable addition yet to our HTML skills. While before we were linkeded to rather small-scale endeavors, now it feels as if we have
						all the data in the world at our fingertips.
