			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main purpose of this lab was to become more familliar with sturucturing and transfering files,
					    particularly is the VSCode and Github programs. In addition we learned more about practicing the 
					ins and outs of CSS and HTML, including employing divs, sections, classes and ids in to order our
				website in a desired manner.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While I did already have some experince building websites from Lab 2, on this attempt I had to deal
						with some more complex features. 
							The first obstacle I wish to discuss ismy implimentation of the sparkles to the sides of my Homepage's title,
						wanting to inject some extra life into the page. While Inserting the images themselves was easy enough, it took
						much trial and error to make them inline with the text itself. I was eventually able to achieve this after
						discovering the "span" html tag, did not have the automatic newline features that the "p" text option implimented.
						However, the text was not enlarged, so this needed to be achieved with a seperate ID and CSS settings. 
							Another flourish that I added to my website (which proved difficult) was the list of my personal projects that I would like people to visit
						in the middle of my page. While making an unordered list was simple enough, it was more challenging to find how to arrange
						the elements in a horizontal manner. I was eventually able to achieve this with the "display: inline block" CSS setting.
						With this, the items in the list would be organized in horizontal segments, instead of taking up a whole new line for each entry.
							This was more of an artistic difficulty than a technical one, but it was challenging to find a good color scheme for the site.
						one can change the color of different elements easily in CSS, but making them match well in a different manner. There were a few occasions
						where I chose colors that I thought were just swell on their own, but looked absolutley horrendous once the site loaded and they
						were put together. I was able to settle on a unifying color scheme by taking inspiration of one of my favorite characters, and using
						colors typically assosiated with them. Can you guess <a href="https://preview.redd.it/b3px90jwsix51.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=71a1b64a2cb3cd71c744cc7f5972f04989485a3d">who</a>? (Most likley not if you weren't obsessed
						with webcomimcs of the 2010s, but I love using them as a profile picture!)

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? 
						As I am going to be using this website as a homepage for quite some time, I didn't want to just throw in the minimum and quit. This was my
						first website! I wanted to learn to make it ✧･ﾟsparkle*✧･ﾟ! While some changes I expected to be difficult were easy to impliment (images, changing color)
						many other elements I expected to be simple were quite frustrating to make work, taking much trial and error (images in line with text, horizontally
						ordered lists, etc). I have a newfound respect for those who have the dedication to build websites
