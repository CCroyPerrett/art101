        <p>Hi my name is Joey, I'm a 3rd year AGPM major with a little bit of programming experience. 
            I mainly play a lot of video games such as various Pokemon games, Terraria, Minecraft, and Super Smash Bros among others. 
            More recently I've been doing a lot of amiibo training in Super Smash Bros Ultimate and doing amiibo tournaments with my friend. 
            I like to draw digitally on occasion that I normally just make for myself, but I have also drawn emotes for discord and twitch. 
            I also like to do some video editing sometimes but those are few and far between most of the time.</p>

        <p>Hello! I am Chase Croy-Perrett, a UCSC computer science student, and I am exited to be here and learn!
            I have long been interested in learning digital art and game design, I used to make projects on Scratch
            (a rudimentary game-making website) for hours! And although I may be a little out of practice at the moment,
            (due to school and other commitments...) I also enjoy drawing diggitaly with my tablet, although mostly comics & funny
            bits about games I like. I'm making a lot of big changes, and I'm looking forewards to be able to show the 
            world once I am done! I'll see you there!
