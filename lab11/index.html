			<h1>Lab 11 - Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create an input box in an html document with a button that will take the input and turn it into a variable. Modify the input with the sort
						name function from several labs ago and print it on the screen.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> At first, we worked through getting the input and button to work exactly as we wanted. All of it was fixed via trial and error.
						We had a problem where the input would delete the button and input boxes, but it turned out we just needed to use .append not .html.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went by very quickly. We knew how to do most of the implementation due to going over it in class, and we also had
						our sortname function that we just took from the previous lab. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<input type="text" id="user-name" placeholder="Input your name"></input>

					</div>
						<input type="text" id="user-anagram" placeholder="Input your name" maxlength="9"></input>
						<!-- <button onclick="display()" id="submit">Submit</button> -->
						<button id="anagram">Submit</button>
						<br> <p>And here are all the anagrams of your name! <br>
						(Character limit 9 due to exponential runtime growth).</p>
