			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experiment with JSON and APIs by using the XKCD comic API.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Compared to the previous assignment, we had no trouble at all dealing with this API!
						We may havegone a little overeager the last time... jumping straight into a complex
					    API and having to figure out how to use them from scratch, that this was pretty much
					no troble at all! This is the first webpage we have built however that changes it's Results
				over time, giving reason to come back again later! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was an excellent culmination of everything we have learned so far.
						While previous assignments were one-and-done exercises, showcasing some trick to the
					    audience, they have no reason to ever come back after initial experimentation. But with a new
				        comic being displayed every week, users have reasons to come back time and again!
			            Now, with our new knowledge of APIs, I feel empowered, as if we have all the power of the internet
					    at our fingertips! I am excited to put this knowledge to use in my final project.</p>
