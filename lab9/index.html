					<h2 id ="chal">Challenge</h2>
					<div id="chmsg" class="unreadable"> Oh... I guess you could... </div>
					<p>Use jQuery to add buttons and toggle a class in a javascript file.</p>

					<h2 id ="prob">Problems</h2>
					<div id="prmsg" class="unreadable"> Oh, with the left mouse button, of course! How could I forget! Thank you for the knowledge.</div>
					<p>When we had originally implemented our buttons, they first appeared after the div section. To fix this, we just needed to create IDs
						for the headings so that we could target them specifically with .after. We then had trouble toggling the class to show and hide. We 
						originally tried to make a global variable to track when the div is hidden and when it is being shown. Then we would run an if statement
						to change the visibility, but it would fail to reveal it if it was hidden. This was before we knew about toggleClass, so that was easily
						able to solve our problems.  </p>

					<h2 id ="refl">Reflection</h2>
					<div id="refmsg" class="unreadable"> Wait a second, I shouldn't be having an exestential crisis! I'm a button!</div>
					<p>This assignment was helpful in demonstrating what jQuery can do. Toggling classes is simple and easy, and adding buttons is able versatile yet quick to implement. </p>
